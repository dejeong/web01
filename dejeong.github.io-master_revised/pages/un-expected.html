          We have long for beauty and created it at the beginning of humankind.
          When it comes to beauty, it is hard to define and describe how we feel
          about beauty. As a designer and artist, we are always looking for new
          beauty and trying to create it in our daily life. However, beauty is
          everywhere in our lives although we want to create the strangeness
          and new. Sometimes, we look daily objects very different in unusual
          context, and it is a new kind of pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started this project, I was struggling to get out of boredom of
          my works which are very similar. It made me get sick of creating
          something new. One day, I looked at my stuff on my desk, catching the
          light of the sunset and they seemed amazingly beautiful. There are just
          a coffee cup, some left-over bread and stationaries. Iʼve never
          expected they could be beautiful. It happens sometimes in our daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to look into materialism and think the meaning of objects if
          they donʼt have any functions and usage. In this sense, I intent to
          present the everydayʼs beauty through photography. This is a series of
          photography that celebrates the pure materiality and simplicity in daily
          objects. Stepping away from the function, each scultures phogographed
          were made by the objects soley from an aesthetic point of view.

      My practice focuses on telling the story through photography. I love to capture the moments of daily life and narrative around simple objects. I enjoy combining pure graphic design with photography to create the visual languages.
